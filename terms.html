    Subscriptions
</p>
<p>
    Optional subscription "Premium" is available if you would like to use without ads. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
</p>
<p>
    Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.
</p>
<p>
    All Subscriptions may be final and non-refundable. By accepting these terms, you agree that WizardFactory is not required to provide a refund for any reason. WizardFactory may change, modify, or eliminate features of the Subscription at any time, with or without notice. Any Subscription fee change will not go into effect automatically; you must opt into the fee change to continue using the Subscription after the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
